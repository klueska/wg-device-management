# An alternate example of what a node with two PFs, each with
# two VFs might look like.
#
# In this device, the behavior is:
# - Each card has two PFs
# - Each PF has 2 VFs
# - The devices that are published are PFs and VFs, and they
#   are published with pf/vf capacity, which is used to differentiate
#   between asking for a pf and a vf.
