# A Pod with three secondary SR-IOV network interfaces, attached to specific
# IP networks.
#
# In this example, we imagine that example.com has implemented a set of network
# controllers that know how to attach to different networks. These run as DRA
# drivers on nodes, and based on the node context they may attach networks via
# VLAN tags/VRF-lite, or VPN tunnels, or whatever. It need not be known to the
# workload author.
#
# These IP networks are defined via CRs:
