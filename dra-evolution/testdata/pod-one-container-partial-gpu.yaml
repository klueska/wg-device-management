# A Pod asking for a share of a Foozer GPU with an advisory hold
# of 8Gi of memory. Since Foozer devices cannot actually enforce
# that the container will only get 8GB, this requires some good
# faith on the part of users.
#
# NOTE: AllowShared boolean is not part of the model yet, but
# if we decide we want to support the fractional device case,
# we will need it or some form of 'access mode'.
